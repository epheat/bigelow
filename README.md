a website for the üÖ±Ô∏èigelow house

## how to run
first, go to root directory and install dependencies
`npm install`

if you don't have npm yet, use `nvm` to install it.

by that, I mean run `nvm install node` not 'npm'

### backend

we use serverless for the bigelow backend. `npm install -g serverless`

to run the backend locally, `cd` into the bigelow-service directory and run `npm install`. then, run `serverless offline`

you need the right credentials to be able to run the lambda locally. acquire your AWS credentials to your IAM user in scott's AWS account. then run the command `serverless config credentials -p aws --key xxx --secret yyy` to set up your `"~/.aws/credentials` file. TODO: find out how to automatically copy from .env file

### frontend

we use webpack dev server to serve the bigelow front end with hot reload.

to run the frontend, navigate to the root directory and run `npm run dev`. Then navigate in your browser of choice to http://localhost:8080 .

to bundle the frontend and upload to s3, you need credentials in your .env file. Update your .env file with AWS credentials to your IAM user in scott's AWS account in the same format as the .env.sample file. then run `npm run build`

### both

to run the front and backend at the same time, run `npm start` from the root directory.

## rules

make sure it actually builds before committing it

pull before push

bigelow boys are the best in the business
